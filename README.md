# rn-workshop

## Prerequisites

Follow the setup guide for iOS/Mac on React Native's [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) 
page. Make sure to do this before coming to the workshop, because some of these steps are time-consuming (Xcode, we're looking at you) 
and we don't want to waste time on installations when we should be coding.

When you're done, make sure to run `react-native run-ios` to make sure everything works.
