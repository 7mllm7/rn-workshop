# rn-workshop

## Prerequisites

<i>Note: Unfortunately, you'll need a Mac to participate in this workshop. You can't develop iOS apps without a Mac, and we'll be focusing on iOS first to keep things simple and straightforward.</i>

Follow the setup guide for iOS/Mac on React Native's [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) page. Make sure to do this before coming to the workshop, because some of these steps are time-consuming (Xcode, we're looking at you) 
and we don't want to waste time on installations when we should be coding.

The tldr of what you need is: 

- Mac
- Homebrew
- Node 4.0+ (`brew install node`)
- React Native CLI (`npm install -g react-native-cli`)
- Xcode 7.0+ 
- Watchman (`brew install watchman`)
- Flow (`brew install flow`)

When you're done, make sure to run `react-native run-ios` to make sure everything works.
